# In a quiet village at the edge of the Enchanted Forest, there lay an ancient scroll containing the wisdom of ages. The scroll was filled with words—some long, some short—woven together to form a great tale. Over time, some of the words had become buried beneath the folds of the scroll, overshadowed by spaces that separated them.

# One day, a curious adventurer named Elara discovered the scroll. Intrigued, she decided to read through it and uncover the hidden wisdom. As she traced her finger along the words, she became captivated by the very last section of the tale.

# Though many words were scattered throughout the scroll, Elara wanted to uncover the length of the last one in the sequence. She could see it at the very end, but it was hidden among the spaces. Elara was determined to find out how long this word was, the one that could hold the secret to the scroll’s full meaning.
